# University-Management-System-Python-Project-
A python project using json and time library. It is a simple University student database management system.

Contents /n
Student Data json File
History Data json File
Initial time stamp creation file i.e. to create the history data json file
Ums creation Code (Main code)

Before running the code upload the student and history json file in the respective folder so that the code can access it or it through an file not found error. 
Initial time stamp creation file is for reference on how the history data json file is created.

This project is a simple University students data management system. I have used json and time library in it. There are two parts in it 1. Registration, where the student put in their data and their data is recorded for the first time. I have programmed the code to be dynamic so it won't take any wrong information other than the instructed information it tells to feed in it. It also notes down the time and date of registration. 2. Viewing details, where the Student or any faculty can view any student's details as required by stating their registration number. It notes down how many times a student's data was referred and the time and data of when it was last referred. 

Thank you for giving a look on my project! Have a fine day ahead!
